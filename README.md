Feed Reader Project
===============================

This project teaches one how to test for proper functioning in your js/html/css/etc files using [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html).

## "Opening and running the App":
* Go to the link https://benjaminmartin05.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/ to open the app.
* Open file index.html in a browser to run the project if attempting to do so locally.
## Helpful feed reader project information:
* I used the [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html) to primarily build my project making adjustments to their examples.
* [Udacity](http://udacity.com/) discussion forums were also used to create my tests .
